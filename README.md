# Neuro Life

_2D open-world game built with Rust and Bevy where creatures evolve using neural networks._

## Features
- **Open World**: Creatures can explore and interact with the environment.
- **Evolution**: Neural networks control the behavior of creatures, allowing them to adapt and evolve.
- **Rust and Bevy**: Leveraging the power of Rust's safety and Bevy's ECS for efficient game mechanics.

## Getting Started
1. Install Rust: [Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/neuro-life.git
   cd neuro-life
   cargo run
# Roadmap

Add creatures and movement mechanics
Implement food generation and consumption
Introduce neural networks for creature behavior

    Enable creature reproduction and evolution
