# Neuro Life

2D open-world game built with Python and Pygame where creatures evolve using neural networks.
# Features

    Open World: Creatures can explore and interact with the environment.
    Evolution: Neural networks control the behavior of creatures, allowing them to adapt and evolve.
    Python and Pygame: Utilizing Python's simplicity and Pygame's game development tools for intuitive and efficient mechanics.

# Getting Started

    Install Python: Python Installation Guide
    Install required dependencies:

``` pip install pygame numpy ```

# Clone the repository:
```
    git clone https://github.com/superbodik/NeiRo-life-python
    cd neuro-life-python
    python src/main.py
```
# Roadmap

    Add creatures and implement basic movement mechanics.
    Develop food generation and consumption system.
    Introduce neural networks for controlling creature behavior.
    Enable creature reproduction and evolution over generations.
    Improve the open-world environment with diverse biomes and obstacles.
