# Neuro Life

2D open-world game built with C++ and SFML where creatures evolve using neural networks.
Features

    Open World: Creatures can explore and interact with the environment, uncovering new areas and discovering resources.
    Evolution: Neural networks control the behavior of creatures, enabling them to adapt, learn, and evolve over time.
    C++ and SFML: Harnessing the power and speed of C++ combined with the ease of use provided by SFML to create a smooth and efficient gaming experience.

# Getting Started

 # 1. Install Prerequisites

Before running the game, make sure you have the following installed:

- **C++ Compiler**: Install a C++ compiler like GCC, Clang, or MSVC.
- **CMake**: You will need CMake to build the project. Download it from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/).
- **SFML**: This game uses SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for rendering. Follow the installation guide on [SFML's website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).


# 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/superbodik/NeiRo-life-cpp
cd Neuro-life-cpp
```
# 3. Build and Run the Game

To build the project, create a build directory, configure CMake, and compile the game:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./NeuroLife
```
This will compile the project and launch the game.
Roadmap

    • Add Creatures: Implement basic creature movement and interaction with the world.
    • Food System: Develop a food generation and consumption system that supports creature survival.
    • Neural Networks: Introduce neural networks to control creature behavior and decision-making processes.
    • Reproduction and Evolution: Enable creatures to reproduce and evolve over generations.
    • Open-World Biomes: Expand the environment with diverse biomes, obstacles, and dynamic weather conditions.
